# Currently, the KNETWK and KHOLE have already been set, going forward.
#
# Only exception where this needed to be done by hand is 2017/06/19
# when the conversion between old and new file name convention
# happened right at the 18th hour. 
#
# [Historical note: if MSEED2SAC returns more than one file, dated at
# past the ??000 hour, these were due to small timing errors, and we
# got rid of those, while keeping a log. GPS fixed 06/20/2017.]
